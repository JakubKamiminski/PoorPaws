# PoorPaws
WHAT IT IS:

This application was made for my school project, it is a prototype software for fictional company called Poor Paws, it's a company that wants to sell animals it rescued through
this application. Admin users can browse through available nimals, add new animals to the databsae, edit old ones, and delete animals. Normal users can only browse through available
animals

IMPORTANT

The app frozes when you delete animal that isn't last in the database, so for example if there 7 animals and you delete animal with ID 4 and create a gap between ID 3 and ID 5 the app
will freeze, so it's recommended to only delete the animal with highest ID/last one in databse, so if there are 7 animals the animal with ID 7, when you want to get rid off animal
that isn't last just use edit feature the change the data of that animal to the data of the new animal you want to recplace old one with

When loading up app for the first time "database file created" textbox will appear and after you close it the app will show up. After that happens close the app, go to the "db" folder
copy the database inside of it. Go to the assigmentloginform folder, then to the bin folder, then the debug folder, and inside of it replace the databse file with the database file 
you copied from the db folder.
